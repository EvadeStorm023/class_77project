            <h3>About console</h3>
            <p>
                The console is a place to test out your coding before you start
                too insure no mistakes, you can get to the console screen in two 
                ways. The first one is to create a script tag and start testing 
                or you can go see the result of your web page and right click,
                click on inspect and test to your limites. To print anything on
                the console screen you just need to type console.log(), then just
                type what you want to in the rounded bracketsand click enter.
                These are the simple thing for console I will share more when I go
                deeper into this subject
